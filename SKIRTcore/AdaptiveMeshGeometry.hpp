/** The AdaptiveMeshGeometry class describes an arbitrary 3D geometry defined by the
    probability distribution imported from an adaptive mesh data file. The data file must have a
    format supported by one of the AdaptiveMeshFile subclasses. The AdaptiveMeshGeometry class
    allows selecting the data column containing the probability distribution, and it offers the
    option to use a second column as a multiplication factor (i.e. the probability distribution is
    then defined by the product of the two column values). The geometry will be normalized anyway
    after importing the probability distribution, so the probability distribution in the data file
    does not have to be normalized, and the units of the values in the data file are irrelevant.
    Since the adaptive mesh data format does not specify the size of the domain, this information
    must be provided as properties of this class as well. */
