/** This is the base class for all classes in the simulation hierarchy. It inherits from QObject so
    that we can use the Qt facilities for object hierarchies and for class introspection.
    Simulation items form a compile-time class hierarchy through inheritance (with the
    SimulationItem class at the top), and a run-time object hierarchy using the QObject
    parent/children mechanism (usually with an instance of a MonteCarloSimulation subclass at the

        sets any attributes to null values rather than to meaningful defaults (to avoid the extra
        construction time). Thus all attributes in the simulation hierarchy must have been
        explicitly set by the caller before invoking setup(). If setup() has already been invoked

        an appropriate item among all ancestors of the receiving item (including the receiving item
        itself) and their immediate children. In other words, it recursively runs upwards along the
        ancestors and goes just one level down for each ancestor. The function returns the first
        appropriate item found; if multiple items of the same type exist in the hierarchy, there is
        no telling which one of these will be returned. If no appropriate item is found, the

        function returns a pointer to it, or rather to the simulation item that implements the
        interface after it has been dynamically cast to the requested interface type. If no
        interface of the requested type is found, the function returns a null pointer. Thus the
        caller must check the returned pointer before dereferencing it.

        By default only the receiving simulation item is considered as a candidate for implementing
        the interface, but a simulation item subclass can provide a longer list of candidates to
