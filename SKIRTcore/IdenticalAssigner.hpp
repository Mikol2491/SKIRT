/** The IdenticalAssigner class is a subclass of the ProcessAssigner class, representing objects
    that assign work to different processes. In its primary use, the IdenticalAssigner assign each
    process to the same work. When a certain method in another class requires the execution of
    different small parts of work, and it uses an object of this class as the process assigner,
    then all processes will execute all these parts. The execution of these parts is thus not
    parallelized with regard to the different processes, so the same result is expected on each
    process afterwards. In this case, the parallel() function of this class will return \em false,
    meaning that parallelizing the work amongst different threads is not allowed. Since each
    process executes the same algorithm, no communication is needed afterwards to accumulate the
    results.

    The assignment mechanism explained above is represented graphically in the following figure.

    \image html identicalassigner.png "The IdenticalAssigner class assigns each process to the same work."

    When the assignment procedure of this class (the assign() function) is called with a number of
    blocks that is greater than one, the behaviour is completely different. In each block, each
    process is assigned to all of the parts of work, similar as its standard behaviour, but the
    processes are not assigned to each block. Instead, an instance of the SequentialAssigner class
    is used to distribute the blocks amongst the different processes. Subsequent calls to
    absoluteIndex, relativeIndex or rankForIndex are then redirected to this companion assigner.
    Naturally, the parallel() function will now return true, since each block (and each part of
    work associated with it) is assigned to only one process. The rationale for this behaviour,
    apart from its usefulness in the MonteCarloSimulation class (and subclasses) for shooting
    photon packages, is that using an IdenticalAssigner to assign \f$n\f$ parts of work and copying
    this assignment scheme for \f$m\f$ blocks (\f$m>0\f$) would be completely analogous to simply
    assigning \f$n \times m\f$ parts of work (since each process would be assigned to each part of
    work and consequently to every block too). Therefore, the behaviour of the IdenticalAssigner is
    different from the other assigners in the way that it treats these blocks; instead of copying
    the assigment for each block, the IdenticalAssigner essentially becomes a parallel assigner
    when \c blocks > 1. */

        in the simulation hierarchy (so it will automatically be deleted) and the setup of the

        argument is omitted from the call to this function, or set to 1, the assigment procedure in
        this class is straightforward and does not require any calculations. In this case, each process
        is assigned to each part of work. The value of the \em size argument is just copied into the \c
        _nvalues member. If \c blocks > 1, not all \c size \f$\times\f$ \c blocks parts of work are
        assigned to each process. Each block is assigned entirely to one particular process, but the
        assignment of these blocks to the different processes is directed by an instance of the

        case. Therefore, the programmer must ensure that this function is never called for an object of
        the IdenticalAssigner class if the number of blocks is one. If this function does get called in
        that case, a fatal error is thrown. If \c blocks > 1, calling this function does make sence,
