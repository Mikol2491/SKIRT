/** Log is the abstract base class for a message logging mechanism. It offers convenience functions
    for logging messages at various levels (info, warning, success, error), adding a time-stamp
    along the way. All of these functions eventually call a single pure virtual function, which
    must be implemented in a subclass to actually output the message to a device such as the
    console or a file. */

        hierarchy has not yet been created, the function returns and _procName retains its empty state.
        If the find algorithm does succeed, the find algorithm is applied again, this time to invoke
