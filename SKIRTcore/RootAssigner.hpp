/** The RootAssigner class is a subclass of the ProcessAssigner class, representing objects that
    assign work to different processes. The RootAssigner class is used to assign all of the work to
    the root process, as defined by the PeerToPeerCommunicator class, so that the other processes
    do not execute the corresponding code. This is useful for e.g. I/O operations; therefore
    objects of type RootAssigner will be found in various writeXXX() functions across the \c SKIRT
    code. The RootAssigner is also the only type of ProcessAssigner that can be used when there is
    no PeerToPeerCommunicator available, for example in code that is outside of the simulation
    hierarchy and/or where the multiprocessing environment is not (yet) initialized, or in the
    MasterSlaveManager class (used by \c FitSKIRT). If this PeerToPeerCommunicator is not
    available, a value of zero can be passed to the constructor of RootAssigner. In this case, the
    RootAssigner object assumes multiprocessing is not enabled and thus every process that uses it
    is considered root and will be consequently assigned to all of the work. In MasterSlaveManager,
    this is useful since a certain workload is already specific to a certain process, so we want to
    assign all parts of this work to this process, but we can't use an IdenticalAssigner since this
    assigner can not be combined with multithreading (IdenticalAssigner::parallel() returns false). */

        in the simulation hierarchy (so it will automatically be deleted) and the setup of the
