/** The RandomAssigner class is a subclass of the ProcessAssigner class, representing objects that
    assign work to different processes. An object of the RandomAssigner class distributes the work
    amongst the different processes in a random way. For each value (part of work), the assigned
    process is determined by drawing a uniform random number. Because the state of the random
    number generator can be different in each process, each process performs the random assignment
    for a subset of the different values, after which the results are gathered across all
    processes.

    When the assignment procedure of this class (the assign() function) is called with a number of
    blocks that is greater than one, the randomly determined assignment scheme is repeated \f$m\f$
    times, where \f$m\f$ is the number of blocks. */

        in the simulation hierarchy (so it will automatically be deleted) and the setup of the
        ProcessAssigner base class is invoked, which sets the _comm attribute that points to the object
        of type PeerToPeerCommunicator that is found in the simulation hierarchy. */

        from 0 to \f$n-1\f$), this function determines the rank of the assigned process, by drawing
        random numbers from a uniform distribution. By using a SequentialAssigner, the range of indices
        \f$i\f$ is split in different domains, so that each process must draw these random numbers only
        for one particular domain. Subsequently, the randomly determined ranks are synchronized across
        all processes, so that every process knows which process is assigned to any part of the work
        (stored in the _assignment vector). Each process then determines which values it is assigned to
        itsself, and stores these values in a seperate list (the _values attribute). This function also
        sets the _blockSize, _valuesInBlock and _nvlaues attributes.
