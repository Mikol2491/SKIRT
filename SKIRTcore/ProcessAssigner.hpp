/** ProcessAssigner is an abstract class representing objects that assign different parts of work
    to the different processes in the simulation. Different subclasses of ProcessAssigner do this
    in different ways. A ProcessAssigner can be a part of any item in the simulation hierarchy. The
    DustLib object for example, can incorporate a ProcessAssigner object to define the way in which
    the process work together to calculate the dust emission for the different library items. The
    ProcessAssigner can also be associated with for example the WavelengthGrid, to assign the
    simulation of different wavelengths to different processes. The ProcessAssigner is always used
    in combination with the PeerToPeerCommunicator of the simulation. The latter defines the
    communications needed between the processes, while the former defines the work assignment. The
    MasterSlaveCommunicator implements the work assignment itself; letting one process hand out
    the parts of work to the others by sending messages. */

        subclass must ensure that the assign function determines the number of values that are assigned
        to the process, and stores it in the _nvalues member. The typical behaviour of a subclass would
        be to repeat its assignment scheme used for the first \c size values, for as many times as
