/** An instance of the BruzualCharlotSEDFamily class represents the family of Bruzual & Charlot
    SEDs for single stellar populations, parameterized on metallicity and age (Bruzual & Charlot
    2003, RAS 344, 1000-1026). The data was downloaded from
    http://www2.iap.fr/users/charlot/bc2003/. We use the low resolution version of the
    Padova1994/chabrier model, which is one of the two recommended models. The Bruzual & Charlot
    library data is read from the appropriate resource files during setup, and it is subsequently
    interpolated to the desired parameters and wavelength grid points by calling the luminosities()
    function as often as needed. */
